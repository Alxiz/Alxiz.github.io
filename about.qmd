# Self-introduction

I am Chunxi, a year 2 student majoring in Philosophy. Philosophy has changed my life in unimaginable ways. I get to look at life from different perspectives and find the best way to live my life. Well, after all, how can we claim that we lived if we do not even know what life is?

Besides that, I am also interested in fashion, especially Japanese fashion. I am currently looking into Japanese Americana, which has a unique blend of American work wear and Japanese streets tyle.
